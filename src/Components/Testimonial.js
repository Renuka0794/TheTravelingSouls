      "I have been with the travelling souls since two trips now and prefer to join the upcoming trips too. It has been a great journey with them so far. I had the most adventurous trip of my life with travelling souls i.e. Jibhi and Tirthan valley. It could have been disastrous trip without them. Also, they have ideas and good knowledge of the underrated areas in Manali, Jibhi and many other areas which have amazing views.\nSo overall an amazing group of people and my friends lead this best trip organising group.",

      "The manali trip was my first trip with any travelling agency, it was amazing and worth every penny. The execution of trip was flawless. The most important thing is involvement of every member, and it didn't feel like, we all were meeting for first time. We all enjoyed so much. I will keep this agency on my first priority for any of my next trip.\nThank you travelling souls for this memorable trip.",

      "I travelled recently with The Travelling Souls on a new year trip to Manali. The experience was awesome. Our organisers were so friendly, they made the trip real fun. The whole trip was so hassle free that you do not have to think about anything else rather than having fun. Huge shout-out to Ankit and Sahil for being such great travel coaches. Looking forward to travel again with them.",
