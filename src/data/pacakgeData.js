      "Jibhi, a quiet hamlet tucked into Great Himalayan National Park, is situated in Tirthan Valley. Tirthan Valley gets its name from the tirtha river which flows through the valley. This valley is famous for its offbeat destination, lush green valleys, flowings rivers, various treks, viewpoints, and quiet spots for its tourists. A few famous treks here are Jalori Pass, Chehni Fort, Raghupur Fort, Shringa Rishi Temple, and the 360Â° viewpoint of Serolsar Lake. On this trip, we will be covering a few of these places along with short hikes to Choi waterfall, Jibhi waterfall, and mini thailand. Apart from treks and viewpoints, this place is also famous for its freshwater fish - 'Trout Fish'. One can try fishing in the river too at a budget price.",
